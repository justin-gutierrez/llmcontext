 # Flask Configuration, Usage, Errors, and Examples

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework designed for ease of use with the ability to scale for complex applications. It depends on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, Jinja template engine, and Click CLI toolkit.

## Installation

Install Flask using pip or conda.

## Quickstart

- A minimal application
- Debug mode
- HTML escaping
- Routing
- Static files
- Redirects and errors
- About responses
- Sessions
- Message flashing
- Logging
- WSGI middleware usage
- Flask extensions
- Deploying to a web server

## Tutorial

A detailed tutorial on creating a small but complete application with Flask.

## Configuration

Flask provides configuration and conventions, with sensible defaults, to get started. This section explains different parts of the Flask framework, customization, and extension.

### Basic Configuration

- Debug mode
- Builtin configuration values
- Configuring from Python files
- Configuring from data files
- Configuring from environment variables

### Signals

- Core signals
- Subscribing to signals
- Creating signals
- Sending signals

## Core

- Application structure and lifecycle
- The application context
- The request context

## Routing

- Basic reusable view
- URL variables
- View lifetime and `self`
- View decorators
- Method hints
- Method dispatching and APIs

## Blueprints

- Why blueprints?
- Registering blueprints
- Nesting blueprints
- Blueprint resources
- Blueprint error handlers

## Extensions

- Finding extensions
- Using extensions
- Building extensions
- Command Line Interface
- Application discovery
- Development server
- PyCharm integration
- Development server command line
- Working with the shell
- Creating a request context
- Custom commands
- Plugins
