 Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows custom design creation within HTML. It can be installed using npm or CDN, and configuration is done through a `tailwind.config.js` file. The framework provides utility classes for common CSS properties such as spacing, colors, typography, and layout. Responsive design is achieved using prefixes like md: and lg:. Hover and focus states can also be styled. Common patterns like Card Component and Navigation Bar are provided in examples. Errors might occur if the configuration or usage is incorrect.
