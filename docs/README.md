# Documentation Storage

This directory contains optimized documentation files generated by LLMContext.

## Purpose

The `docs/` directory serves as a cache and storage location for:
- Processed and compressed framework documentation
- LLM-optimized content for RAG applications
- Tagged and embedded context ready for retrieval

## File Format

Documentation files are stored in Markdown format with the following structure:
- Framework name as filename (e.g., `fastapi.md`)
- Compressed and optimized content
- Embedded metadata and tags
- Source attribution

## Usage

These files are automatically generated when processing codebases and can be:
- Served via the API endpoints
- Accessed through the CLI
- Used directly for RAG applications

## Maintenance

- Files are automatically updated when frameworks are re-processed
- Old versions are replaced with newer optimized content
- The directory structure is managed by LLMContext
