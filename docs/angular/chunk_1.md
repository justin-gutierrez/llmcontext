Usage:

To configure and use Angular, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js (version 16 or later) and npm (version 8 or later).
2. Install Angular CLI by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
3. Create a new Angular application with the desired project name using `ng new my-app`.
4. Navigate into the newly created directory: `cd my-app`.
5. Start the development server with `ng serve`.
6. Build the application for production using `ng build --prod`.

Errors:

Common errors might include:

1. Not having Node.js and npm installed. Check your system for these prerequisites.
2. Incorrect versions of Node.js or npm. Update to the recommended versions.
3. Unable to find `@angular/cli`. Reinstall it globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
4. Issues during project creation. Check for any error messages and troubleshoot accordingly.
5. Build errors for production. Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date, and check the build logs for details on specific issues.

Examples:

Here's a basic Angular component example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: '<h1>Welcome to {{title}}</h1>'
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'My Angular App';
}
```
