 # FastAPI Configuration, Usage, Errors, and Examples

FastAPI provides a hybrid approach for creating APIs with PUT requests. For PUT requests to `/items/{item_id}`, it reads the body as JSON, checking for required attributes:
- `name` (str)
- `price` (float)
- `is_offer` (optional bool)

It also supports validation constraints such as `maximum_length` and `regex`. FastAPI generates client code in multiple languages and provides interactive documentation web interfaces.

## Features

- Declaration of parameters from various sources: headers, cookies, form fields, files
- Dependency Injection system
- Security and authentication (OAuth2, JWT tokens, HTTP Basic auth)
- GraphQL integration
- Additional features such as WebSockets, tests based on HTTPX and pytest, CORS, Cookie Sessions, etc.

## Performance

FastAPI applications running under Uvicorn rank among the fastest Python frameworks available in independent TechEmpower benchmarks.

## Dependencies

FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette. The standard group of optional dependencies includes:
- email-validator (for email validation)
- httpx (required for TestClient)
- jinja2 (required for default template configuration)
- python-multipart (required for form parsing)
- uvicorn (for the server that loads and serves your application)
- fastapi-cli (to provide the fastapi command)

## Installation

- Standard Dependencies: `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`
- Without standard dependencies: `pip install fastapi`
- Without fastapi-cloud-cli: `pip install "fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]"`
