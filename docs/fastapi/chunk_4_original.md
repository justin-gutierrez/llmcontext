 PUT). For PUT requests to /items/{item_id}, read the body as JSON: Check that it has a required attribute name that should be a str. Check that it has a required attribute price that has to be a float. Check that it has an optional attribute is_offer, that should be a bool, if present. All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects. Convert from and to JSON automatically. Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by: Interactive documentation systems.

 Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages. Provide 2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly. We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works. Try changing the line with: return {&quot;item_name&quot;: item.name, &quot;item_id&quot;: item_id} ...from: ... &quot;item_name&quot;: item.name ... ...to: ... &quot;item_price&quot;: item.price ... ...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types: For a more complete example including more features, see the Tutorial - User Guide. Spoiler alert: the tutorial - user guide includes: Declaration of parameters from other different places as: headers, cookies, form fields and files. How to set validation constraints as maximum_length or regex. A very powerful and easy to use Dependency Injection system. Security and authentication, including support for OAuth2 with JWT tokens and HTTP Basic auth. More advanced (but equally easy) techniques for declaring deeply nested JSON models (thanks to Pydantic). GraphQL integration with Strawberry and other libraries. Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as: WebSockets extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and pytest CORS Cookie Sessions ...and more. Performance&para; Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show FastAPI applications running under Uvicorn as one of the fastest Python frameworks available, only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*) To understand more about it, see the section Benchmarks. Dependencies&para; FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette. standard Dependencies&para; When you install FastAPI with pip install "fastapi[standard]" it comes with the standard group of optional dependencies: Used by Pydantic: email-validator - for email validation. Used by Starlette: httpx - Required if you want to use the TestClient. jinja2 - Required if you want to use the default template configuration. python-multipart - Required if you want to support form "parsing", with request.form(). Used by FastAPI: uvicorn - for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes uvicorn[standard], which includes some dependencies (e.g. uvloop) needed for high performance serving. fastapi-cli[standard] - to provide the fastapi command. This includes fastapi-cloud-cli, which allows you to deploy your FastAPI application to FastAPI Cloud. Without standard Dependencies&para; If you don't want to include the standard optional dependencies, you can install with pip install fastapi instead of pip install "fastapi[standard]". Without fastapi-cloud-cli&para; If you want to install FastAPI with the standard dependencies but without the fastapi-cloud-cli, you can install with pip install "fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]". Additional Optional Dependencies&para; There are some additional dependencies you might want to install. Additional optional Pydantic dependencies: pydantic-settings - for settings management. pydantic-extra-types - for extra types to be used with Pydantic. Additional optional FastAPI dependencies: orjson - Required if you want to use ORJSONResponse. ujson - Required if you want to use UJSONResponse.
