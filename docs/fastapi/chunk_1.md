 # FastAPI Configuration and Usage

FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, based on standard Python type hints. Key features include:

- High performance, comparable to NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic)
- Faster development time by approximately 200-300% due to fewer bugs and editor support
- Intuitive design with less debugging required
- Compatible with open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (Swagger) and JSON Schema

## Requirements and Installation

- Run `pip install fastapi` to install the necessary dependencies
- To create an API, simply import the FastAPI module and instantiate it
- Run your API using the `run()` method
- Check if it's running with `uvicorn your_api:app --reload` or `uvicorn your_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`

## Examples

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

## Interactive API Docs

FastAPI generates interactive documentation for your API, allowing easy navigation and testing of endpoints.

## Errors

Customize error handling using the `HTTPException` class or other exceptions from FastAPI's built-in exceptions.

## Configuration Details

Configure FastAPI by declaring request parameters, status codes, response models, dependencies, security, middleware, and more. Learn about these topics in the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).
