 FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It's based on standard Python type hints and offers features like fast performance (comparable to NodeJS and Go), fewer bugs, intuitive design, ease of use, robustness, and compatibility with OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards.

Key benefits:
- Fast: High performance, as fast as NodeJS and Go.
- Fewer bugs: Reduces about 40% of human errors.
- Intuitive: Great editor support for completion and less debugging time.
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn, reducing doc reading time.
- Robust: Provides production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
- Standards-based: Compatible with OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards.

Notable sponsors include BlockBee, Platform.sh, Scalar, and PropelAuth. The source code and documentation can be found on GitHub and FastAPI's official website, respectively.

To configure FastAPI, you can follow these steps:
1. Install FastAPI using pip (`pip install fastapi`).
2. Import FastAPI in your Python script (`import fastapi`).
3. Create an instance of the FastAPI application (`app = fastapi.FastAPI()`).
4. Define the routes for your API, including their endpoints and response types.
5. Run your application using the `uvicorn` command (`uvicorn your_script:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`).

In case of errors, ensure that you've correctly defined the required parameters for each route and that there are no syntax or logical errors in your code. You can find examples in FastAPI's documentation on GitHub.
