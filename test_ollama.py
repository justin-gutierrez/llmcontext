    Please summarize the following documentation in a concise way, focusing on key concepts and usage examples:
    
    FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
    The key features are: Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
    Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human-induced errors.
    Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn.
    Less time reading docs. Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
    Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation. Based on open standards.
