The key features are: Fast: Very high performance, on par with Node

JS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available. Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. * Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. * Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs. Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs. Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation. Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema. * estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications. Sponsors&para; Other sponsors Opinions&para; "[...] I'm using FastAPI a ton these days. [...] I'm actually planning to use it for all of my team's ML services at Microsoft. Some of them are getting integrated into the core Windows product and some Office products." Kabir Khan - Microsoft (ref) "We adopted the FastAPI library to spawn a REST server that can be queried to obtain predictions. [for Ludwig]" Piero Molino, Yaroslav Dudin, and Sai Sumanth Miryala - Uber (ref) "Netflix is pleased to announce the open-source release of our crisis management orchestration framework: Dispatch! [built with FastAPI]" Kevin Glisson, Marc Vilanova, Forest Monsen - Netflix (ref) "I‚Äôm over the moon excited about FastAPI. It‚Äôs so fun!" Brian Okken - Python Bytes podcast host (ref) "Honestly, what you've built looks super solid and polished. In many ways, it's what I wanted Hug to be - it's really inspiring to see someone build that." Timothy Crosley - Hug creator (ref) "If you're looking to learn one modern framework for building REST APIs, check out FastAPI [...] It's fast, easy to use and easy to learn [...]" "We've switched over to FastAPI for our APIs [...] I think you'll like it [...]" Ines Montani - Matthew Honnibal - Explosion AI founders - spaCy creators (ref) - (ref) "If anyone is looking to build a production Python API, I would highly recommend FastAPI. It is beautifully designed, simple to use and highly scalable, it has become a key component in our API first development strategy and is driving many automations and services such as our Virtual TAC Engineer." Deon Pillsbury - Cisco (ref) Typer, the FastAPI of CLIs&para; If you are building a CLI app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out Typer. Typer is FastAPI's little sibling. And it's intended to be the FastAPI of CLIs. ‚å®Ô∏è üöÄ Requirements&para; FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants: Starlette for the web parts. Pydantic for the data parts. Installation&para; Create and activate a virtual environment and then install FastAPI: $ pip install &quot;fastapi[standard]&quot; ---&gt; 100% Note: Make sure you put "fastapi[standard]" in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals. Example&para; Create it&para; Create a file main.py with: from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(&quot;/&quot;) def read_root(): return {&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;} @app.get(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;) def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None): return {&quot;item_id&quot;: item_id, &quot;q&quot;
