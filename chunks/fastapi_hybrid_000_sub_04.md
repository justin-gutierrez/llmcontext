 how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types: For a more complete example including more features, see the Tutorial - User Guide. Spoiler alert: the tutorial - user guide includes: Declaration of parameters from other different places as: headers, cookies, form fields and files. How to set validation constraints as maximum_length or regex. A very powerful and easy to use Dependency Injection system. Security and authentication, including support for OAuth2 with JWT tokens and HTTP Basic auth. More advanced (

but equally easy) techniques for declaring deeply nested JSON models (thanks to Pydantic). GraphQL integration with Strawberry and other libraries. Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as: WebSockets extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and pytest CORS Cookie Sessions ...and more. Performance&para; Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show FastAPI applications running under Uvicorn as one of the fastest Python frameworks available, only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*) To understand more about it, see the section Benchmarks. Dependencies&para; FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette. standard Dependencies&para; When you install FastAPI with pip install "fastapi[standard]" it comes with the standard group of optional dependencies: Used by Pydantic: email-validator - for email validation. Used by Starlette: httpx - Required if you want to use the TestClient. jinja2 - Required if you want to use the default template configuration. python-multipart - Required if you want to support form "parsing", with request.form(). Used by FastAPI: uvicorn - for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes uvicorn[standard], which includes some dependencies (e.g. uvloop) needed for high performance serving. fastapi-cli[standard] - to provide the fastapi command. This includes fastapi-cloud-cli, which allows you to deploy your FastAPI application to FastAPI Cloud. Without standard Dependencies&para; If you don't want to include the standard optional dependencies, you can install with pip install fastapi instead of pip install "fastapi[standard]". Without fastapi-cloud-cli&para; If you want to install FastAPI with the standard dependencies but without the fastapi-cloud-cli, you can install with pip install "fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]". Additional Optional Dependencies&para; There are some additional dependencies you might want to install. Additional optional Pydantic dependencies: pydantic-settings - for settings management. pydantic-extra-types - for extra types to be used with Pydantic. Additional optional FastAPI dependencies: orjson - Required if you want to use ORJSONResponse. ujson - Required if you want to use UJSONResponse.
