 to count the number of times a button is clicked. To do this, add state to your component. First, import useState from React: import { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;; Now you can declare a state variable inside your component: function MyButton() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // ... You’ll get two things from useState: the current state (count), and the function that lets you update it (setCount). You can

 give them any names, but the convention is to write [something, setSomething]. The first time the button is displayed, count will be 0 because you passed 0 to useState(). When you want to change state, call setCount() and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter: function MyButton() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt; Clicked {count} times &lt;/button&gt; );} React will call your component function again. This time, count will be 1. Then it will be 2. And so on. If you render the same component multiple times, each will get its own state. Click each button separately: App.jsApp.js ResetForkimport { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;; export default function MyApp() { return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Counters that update separately&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;MyButton /&gt; &lt;MyButton /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } function MyButton() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt; Clicked {count} times &lt;/button&gt; ); } Show more Notice how each button “remembers” its own count state and doesn’t affect other buttons. Using Hooks Functions starting with use are called Hooks. useState is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones. Hooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there. Sharing data between components In the previous example, each MyButton had its own independent count, and when each button was clicked, only the count for the button clicked changed: Initially, each MyButton’s count state is 0The first MyButton updates its count to 1 However, often you’ll need components to share data and always update together. To make both MyButton components display the same count and update together, you need to move the state from the individual buttons “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them. In this example, it is MyApp: Initially, MyApp’s count state is 0 and is passed down to both childrenOn click, MyApp updates its count state to 1 and passes it down to both children Now when you click either button, the count in MyApp will change, which will change both of the counts in MyButton. Here’s how you can express this in code. First, move the state up from MyButton into MyApp: export default function MyApp() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Counters that update separately&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;MyButton /&gt; &lt;MyButton /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );}function MyButton() { // ... we&#x27;re moving code from here ...} Then, pass the state down from MyApp to each MyButton, together with the shared click handler. You can pass information to MyButton using the JSX curly braces, just like you previously did with built-in tags like &lt;img&gt;: export default function MyApp() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Counters that update together&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} /&gt; &lt;MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );} The information you pass down like this is called props. Now the MyApp component contains the count state and the handleClick event handler, and passes both of them down as props to each of the buttons. Finally, change MyButton to read the props you have passed from its parent component: function MyButton({ count, onClick }) { return ( &lt;button onClick={onClick}&gt; Clicked {count} times &lt;/button&gt; );} When you click the button, the onClick handler fires. Each button’s onClick prop was set to the handleClick function inside MyApp, so the code inside of it runs. That code calls setCount(count + 1), increment
