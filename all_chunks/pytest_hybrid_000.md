PyPI package name: pytest A quick example¶ # content of test_sample.py def inc(x): return x + 1 def test_answer(): assert inc(3) == 5 To execute it: $ pytest =========================== test session starts ============================ platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y rootdir: /home/sweet/project collected 1 item test_sample.py F [100%] ================================= FAILURES ================================= _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________ def test_answer(): &gt; assert inc(3) == 5 E assert 4 == 5 E + where 4 = inc(3) test_sample.py:6: AssertionError ========================= short test summary info ========================== FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 4 == 5 ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s ============================= Due to pytest’s detailed assertion introspection, only plain assert statements are used. See Get started for a basic introduction to using pytest. Features¶ Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names) Auto-discovery of test modules and functions Modular fixtures for managing small or parametrized long-lived test resources Can run unittest (including trial) test suites out of the box Python 3.8+ or PyPy 3 Rich plugin architecture, with over 1300+ external plugins and thriving community Documentation¶ Get started - install pytest and grasp its basics in just twenty minutes How-to guides - step-by-step guides, covering a vast range of use-cases and needs Reference guides - includes the complete pytest API reference, lists of plugins and more Explanation - background, discussion of key topics, answers to higher-level questions Bugs/Requests¶ Please use the GitHub issue tracker to submit bugs or request features.
